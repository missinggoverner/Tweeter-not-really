Tweeter-not-really is a Twitter-like web application that I developed to emulate core functionalities of the Twitter platform. The project features a custom API built using Python, while the front end is developed with vanilla JavaScript.

This project serves as an intermediate-level endeavor to demonstrate proficiency in full-stack web development, API design, and client-server architecture.

Backend:

Implemented a RESTful API using Python to handle user authentication, tweet creation, retrieval, and deletion.​
Utilized FastAPI to create efficient and easy-to-use API endpoints.​
Integrated a database using SQLAlchemy for data storage and management.​

Frontend:

Developed the user interface with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to provide a responsive and intuitive experience.​
Implemented features such as user authentication, tweet posting, and dynamic content updates without page reloads.​
